    "Subtlety? More like 'bull in a china shop.' Bravo.",
    "You're about as quiet as a Nosferatu tap-dancing on cobblestones.",
    "Every creak of the floorboards is your personal symphony of failure.",
    "Perhaps next time, you should consider wearing softer boots—or none at all."

    "Your words are a masterpiece of miscommunication. Bravo.",
    "Apparently, your charisma is as dead as you are.",

general_failures = [
    "Failure suits you so well—it’s almost as if it’s tailored.",

    "Well, that was smoother than sandpaper.",
    "Did you trip over your own words, or was that on purpose?",
    "Better luck next time, Romeo. Or, you know, maybe don’t try so hard.",
    "Did you practice that line in front of the mirror... or was it just that bad?",
    "Looks like someone’s charm school diploma got lost in the mail.",
    "Is it a fail, or just... an *impressive* misfire?",
    "You couldn't flirt your way out of a wet paper bag.",

    "Your pickup line was a trainwreck, but at least the tracks were laid out nicely.",
    "I guess that’s one way to make an entrance... if you want to leave immediately.",
    "The attempt was almost charming... if I ignore the awkward pauses.",
    "You definitely have a way with words, but not in a good way.",
    "Is this a flirtation, or are you just reading a bad script?",
    "I think you might need a little more practice... or maybe a different strategy?",
    "You know, there's something special about how you make awkwardness an art form.",
    "Next time, maybe keep the pickup line for your friends. Or not.",
    "That was almost as bad as the last time someone tried to be funny at a wedding.",
    "It was a line, I’ll give you that. A very *interesting* one."
